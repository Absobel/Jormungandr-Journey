This Game tells the story of a young and aspiring serpent who decided to become the biggest and baddest serpent of all of Midgard. Thankfully, the serpent has a lot of food to eat and grow big and strong. But be careful, you can't ever stop, so don't run into your own tail or the walls of the world, or JÃ¶rmungandr will perish (though thankfully, he is immortal, but you would still have to start over).

### How to run

```bash
cargo run
```
